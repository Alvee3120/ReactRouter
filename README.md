React Router is a standard library used in React applications to handle routingâ€”that means switching between different views or pages without reloading the entire page. It makes your React app behave like a multi-page app, while actually running as a Single Page Application (SPA). 

## Step by step way to create a simple project using React Router

### Step-1: Create React-Vite Project 
For Creating React Project using Vite , first we need to 

```js
npm create vite@latest <YourProjectName>
```

after that go to your directory then

```bash
npm install
```

Then if you want to configure tailwind run this command

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

After that configure your vite.config.js file like this

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
```
Add an @import to your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

Start your build process
```bash
npm run dev
```
